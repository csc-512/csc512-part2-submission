# Final Seminal Behavior
```
Final seminal behavior:
  "file.txt" 
  "wordcount.txt" 
  size of "file.txt" 
  size of "wordcount.txt" 
```

# Explaining the result
- file.txt
  - The file itself is detected because it is part of a few assert calls that occur at a branch.

- wordcount.txt
  - The file itself is detected because it is part of a few assert calls that occur at a branch.

- size of file.txt
  - The size of this file is detected because getc is used at multiple branch points to read from the file meaning that the size of the file is important.

- size of wordcount.txt
  -   - The size of this file is detected because getc is used at multiple branch points to read from the file meaning that the size of the file is important.
